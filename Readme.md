CreateTask
=========

Summary and intent
-------------------------
CreateTask is a little hobby project of mine. The purpose of it is for me to be able to create tasks in my tasksystem with a minimal context switch. My primary target for this was to create tasks in Microsoft Outlook but I've started to break that hard dependency apart so that multiple TaskManagers can be created. In this project I also created one for [Trello](http://trello.com).

Disclaimer
-------------
I made this tool is made to fit my needs and not be a general purpose tool. But do with it what you like. My plan is to make it flexible and configurable.

Usage
--------
See the [wiki](https://github.com/nippe/CreateTask/wiki) for details on usage.

In short:

    ct.exe Call Phil about haloween party -tm

Creates a task in Microsoft Outllook with the subject "Call Phil about haloween party" and due date tomorrow.
