CreateTask
=========

CreateTask is a little hobby project of mine. The purpose of it is for me to be able to create tasks in my tasksystem with a minimal context switch. My primary target for this was to create tasks in Microsoft Outlook but I've started to break that hard dependency apart so that multiple TaskManagers can be created. In this project I also created one for Trello.
